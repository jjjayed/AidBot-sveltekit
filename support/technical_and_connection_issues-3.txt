PON â€“ NO LIGHT OR BLINKING LIGHT
If your PON has no light, please do the following steps:
1. Switch off your modem for 5 minutes then switch it back on.
2. Check the condition of the fiber patch cord for any break, bend or damage.
3. Ensure that both ends of the fiber patch cord is inserted correctly.
4. Try to detach and re-attach both ends of the fiber patch cord.
If this process does not work, please create a trouble ticket using our self-service facility by calling (02) 8667 0850 or (045) 598 3000.
