MY PAYMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN CREDITED, HOW DO I FOLLOW UP ON MY INSTALLATION?
Due to limited mobility brought about by lockdowns in various areas, we are having some difficulty installing as fast as we want to. We are doing our best to serve you at the soonest possible time. Please. help us by preparing all permits required to reach your house, if any (ex:brgy permits, gate passes, subdivision or bldg permits, etc.).
