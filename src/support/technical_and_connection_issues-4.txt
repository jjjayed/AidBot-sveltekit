SLOW OR INTERMITTENT CONNECTION
If you are experiencing slow or intermittent connection, please note that your bandwidth is a resource shared by all devices connected to your modem. Try the following basic troubleshooting:
- Detach and attach the fiber patch cord on the modem.
- Turn off and on the Modem for 15 seconds.
Note that the strength of the Wi-Fi signal deteriorates the farther you are from the modem. Physical obstructions also limit Wi-Fi connection integrity. For best results, find a spot clear of obstructions and limit the number of devices concurrently connected to the modem. Should you wish to experience very strong Wi-Fi connections, we recommend to:
- Disconnect the other devices including third part router if any.
- Plug a laptop or computer using a LAN cable directly to the modem to compare results.
- Run speed test at https://convergeict.speedtest.net/.
